# Rethinking Voxels
Hello!

You are looking at rethinking-voxels, a minecraft shaderpack. It is an edited version of Complementary Reimagined, and it follows the same visual style, but it also has coloured lights.

## How to Install

To install this shaderpack, you need to have minecraft 1.19.2 and a shader loader (either [Iris](https://irisshaders.net) (recommended) or [OptiFine](https://optifine.net)). Please do not report bugs that occur when running the shaderpack on testing versions of either shader loader.

Once you have a shader loader installed, you can either clone this repository into your shaderpacks folder, or download it from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/shader/rethinking-voxels)

you can find your shaderpacks folder by opening minecraft with Iris or OptiFine installed, navigating to `Options` -> `Video Settings` -> `Shader Packs` -> `Open Shader Pack Folder`. If you are using Iris, you can also drag-and-drop the zip file in the shader selection menu to install it.
